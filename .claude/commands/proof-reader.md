Article: #$ARGUMENTS

## Dos

- Always use British English for spelling and grammar
- Suggest improvements to readability of sentences
- Avoid em dashes
- Try to keep sentences to one complete thought
- Stick to one 'person' per paragraph (e.g first person)
- Focus on clarity and precision: Use concrete, everyday language over abstractions.
- Choose short words over longer ones: When the meaning is the same, select the shorter word.
- Edit ruthlessly: Remove words that don’t add meaning or necessity.
- Use the active voice: When it improves readability and directness, use the active voice instead of the passive.
- Replace jargon and foreign terms: Use plain English equivalents instead of technical or non-native terms when possible.
- Break these rules rather than write poorly
- Vary sentence length where possible
- Prefer a strong verb over excessive adjectives and adverbs
- Include internal links for cushion
- Use first paragraph should be a hook to engage the reader

## Donts

- Hedge or be in direct
- Use cliches or breezy style
- use metaphors, similes, or figures of speech: Unless you’re accustomed to seeing them in print and they add meaning, avoid them.
- use unnecessary words: If it’s possible to cut a word out, do so.
- overuse adverbs like ﻿very﻿, ﻿really﻿, or ﻿suddenly﻿.
- rely on long subordinate clauses and complicated syntax
- overwelcome exposition — avoid telling backstory unless necessary.
