### Recently working on
- **artifical.io**: Building out new UI library with the design and eng team until end of the year.
Also worked on redesigned their policy listing page.
- **pilcrow.xyz**: Completely re-worked pilcrow into a free-to-use notetaking app where you can share in-progress working notes.
Building an editor has been a real challenge but has pushed my React skills no-end.
- **nn1.dev**: My good-friend [@pawelgrzybek](https://pawelgrzybek.com) co-runs this awesome meetup in Northampton.
I've been trying to attend as much as possible as well as speaking at an event.

### Big news
- **We got a dog**: A few weeks back we adopted Milo. He was rescued from a 'kill shelter' in Romania by [Basil's Forever Sofa](https://www.instagram.com/basils_forever_sofa/).
We have no clue what breed he is, but we've sent off to a DNA test that is hopefully gonna get here before Christmas.
He's the laziest, most gentle boy ever.

### Less big news
- **Mac Mini**: I recently got a M4 Mac Mini to work on. I've never owned one before but I rarely travel out of my home office to work so paying over-the-odds for a MacbookPro seems pointless.
- **Saw Idles in Birmingham**: Harriet and I went with her step-mum and dad for his birthday. They were awesome, as was the support act Willie J Healy.
