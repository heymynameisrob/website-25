This is a [now page](http://nownownow.com/about), inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff)  — a nearly-always updated page of what I’m up to these days. Let’s get to it!

## What I'm doing now
Just refreshed my personal website to add lots of new stuff. Firstly, I've started to put more public posts on here, instead of posting things across social media.
But there's not only blog posts. I've got little design prototypes and projects I've worked on too.

Also I'm currently working Lantum again to help build out some of their AI rota capabilities.
It's really fun jumping back into things again.
