__Here's what I'm doing now:__

### Work
- **Refreshed this website**: Sssh. More here soon.
- **Lantum**: I'm contracting with Lantum, where I used to be Head of Design, hekping them build products for secondary care clinicians. It's fun getting the band back together. As well as working on React Native again.
- **artifical.io**: Building out new UI library with the design and eng team until end of the year.
Also worked on redesigned their policy listing page.

### Milo news
Our kid is now about 7/8 months and the bugger is huge! He's so well trained. Walks perfectly on the lead, comes back when calls, really calm and non-reactive. I've had dogs before but it's been a while. I keep wanting to write a little blog on his training which I think would be interesting to look back on.
