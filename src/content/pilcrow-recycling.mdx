description: A different way to organise notes in Pilcrow

One of my least favorite things is being in an untidy space. My wife would probably scoff at that sentence. 
Yet whenever I'm working, I hate to have things on my desk. Coffee cups, notebooks, my phone, airpods â€“ they all have to go in their place so I don't start to freak out.

I feel the same about my virtual workspace. Whenever I write code, how it's organised is just as important to me as how it works. 
I'm a prolific code commenter and until I started working in teams, didn't realise that everyone didn't do that. 
Whenever I take notes on my phone, I hate having to tidy things up and move things around. 
One-off scribblings like shopping lists, reminders, and psuedo-diary entries need to be exterminated before I can sit down and really write.
This makes organise lots of files, be it code or notes, a massive pain in the arse.

One of the reasons I started to build [Pilcrow](https://pilcrow.xyz) was because I couldn't find a note-taking app that really fit with how I like to write things down.
Everything was either bloated by a million other things, too basic, too complicated, or just plain shit.
Whilst working on it, I've taken hundreds of notes. It started to occur to me that I wanted to avoid the pain of having to tidy things up. So I thought - wouldn't it be good if Pilcrow just tidied things up for you?

This all hinges on Pilcrow's central approach which is similar to a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) where the metaphor of planting, tending, and blooming go hand-in-hand with your writing.
The idea is that notes naturally bloom over time as you tend to them. The ones you plant and keep coming back too grow. The others wither and die. I wanted to take this a step further and have Pilcrow act as your 'assitant gardener' which'll tidy up after you.

## How it works
All notes in Pilcrow are stored in a Postgresql database with a `json` blob containing the content as well as various metadata, such as `title` `last_edited` `tags` etc.
The feature is fairly simple in theory: We'll set up a cron job to check if `last_edited` is older than a certain interval. If so, we'll mark it as `archived` and filter it out of the requests on the frontend.
The approach means that we're not actually deleting or archiving anything. It's always recoverable. But we can filter these out of any results where we just want the most up-to-date notes.

First we need to create the database function that'll perform the check. I'm not a backend dev whatsoever, so had to rely on Postgres documentation and little help from Claude AI to tweak things.

```sql
UPDATE docs d
SET is_archived = true
FROM users u
WHERE d.user_id = u.id
  AND u.archive_interval > 0
  AND d.last_edited < CURRENT_DATE - CAST(u.archive_interval || ' days' AS INTERVAL)
  AND d.is_archived = false;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS archived_count
FROM docs d
JOIN users u ON d.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.archive_interval > 0
  AND d.last_edited < CURRENT_DATE - CAST(u.archive_interval || ' days' AS INTERVAL)
  AND d.is_archived = true;
```

Breaking this down, we essentially make run through each users documents matching the `user_id`. Each user has a value in `archive_interval` that corrosponds to how many days we should allow between that last edit and now before we archive.
If a user has `0` set, we don't do anything.

This function is called by a remote procedure like so:
```ts
try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.rpc("auto_archive_docs");

    if (error) {
      console.error("Error calling auto_archive_docs:", error);
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Failed to archive documents" },
        { status: 500 },
      );
    }

    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: `Successfully archived ${data} documents` },
      { status: 200 },
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Unexpected error:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "An unexpected error occurred" },
      { status: 500 },
    );
  }
```

A daily cron job pings this route and we secure everything with Authorization headers sent from Vercel.

Then on the frontend, we just list out the notes in a page titled 'Recycling':

I've only just started trying this out but it helps keeps everything feeling fresh. I plan to keep recycled notes included in things like search, but mark them accordingly. 
I've already found that it means I can just use the sidebar 'Recent' view for notes as I rarely work on more than ~10 or so at a time.
