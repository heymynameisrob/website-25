artificial.io builds tech products for the insurance industry, primarly in the UK.Working with Lloyds and beyond,
artificial has their own properity programming language as well as various products aimed about both brokers
and underwriters.

I joined artificial over winter 2024 to help bolster their design team. My work at artificial focused mostly on
redesigning parts of their insurance "workbench", an all-in-one platform for brokering and writing insurance policies.

I also led efforts to rebuild their UI library in React, giving them high-quality peices to rapidly build UI following increased customer growth.
