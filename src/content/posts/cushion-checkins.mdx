Ernest Hemingway kept a chart beside his office desk to log his daily word count. When asked why, he said it 'kept him honest.' For distributed teams, staying honest about progress is harder but just as vital.

Cushion is an async work communication app for distributed teams. We built it for teams tired of days dominated by busywork. Our workplaces are more distracting than ever—none more so than chat apps like Slack or Teams. We built Cushion to help teams focus of higher-fidelity, async communication. This helps them stay organised, ke in flow, and get more done.

Most companies rely on frequent status updates during a project: daily standups, project update emails, or regular critiques. These formats sound useful, but they achieve little.

First, they are scheduled. This requires time managing who is free and when, eating into your deadline. It's also difficult to track what was agreed or shown. Discussions veer wildly off course. Agreements are often shaky. You don't discover that X was expected but Y was delivered until it's too late.

Status meetings are also [incredibly expensive](https://tptranscription.co.uk/the-true-cost-of-meetings-in-the-workplace-insights-stats-and-solutions/#:~:text=The%20Financial%20Cost%20of%20Meetings&text=The%20global%20cost%20of%20unproductive,billion%20in%20the%20United%20States). Ten people sit for an hour isn't a one-hour meeting, it's a ten-hour meeting. Lost time, salary, and opportunity cost make a real dent in company revenue.

Our alternative is Checkins.

Checkins are how teams on Cushion stay in sync with one another (and themselves!). These are self-reported regular updates driven entirely by the people who work on the project. They can be set on a daily or weekly cadence and involve as many or few people as you like (even just yourself).

Teams find that writing updates in their own words, on their own schedule, produces higher-quality entries. Best of all, these are logged forever. Teams can easily go back, search, and comment on each checkin post. So if someone does drop the ball, it's easy to figure where it happened.

### Connecting Your Work

Work happens across multiple platforms—whether it's writing posts, updating CRM systems, or pushing code. We automatically import high-priority activities from Cushion into checkins, including written posts, resolved discussions, and provided feedback.

When writing their 'post', users can toggle if they want activity added to it or not. This comes from GitHub, Google Workspace, or Cushion itself. This helps connect your update with real artefacts you've worked on that show progress during your workday. However, some days you don't have "something to show" in that way. Knowledge work means days of just thinking things through or even just slower days. Making this optional takes the pressure off 'having to show something'.

## Staying in the loop
After we shipped v1 of checkins, our early users loved them. They found surprising uses we hadn't imagined. For example, one customer used them to keep track of freelancers he had working for him. At the end of each week, each freelancer would fill in their checkin and attach their GitHub activity. He would use this as part of their 'timesheets'. This also made life for the freelancers so much easier as they had only one update to write a week, instead of multiple which is usually the case.

A founder gave us early feedback. His team had multiple checkins, typically one for each project, which he would check regularly to see if anyone needed unblocking or help. This was difficult because he wouldn't know when someone would post their checkin (and didn't want to be THAT guy chasing people up). "It'd be nice if I could 'subscribe' to a checkin so I can get updates."

We shipped this update, giving users a way to subscribe or not to each checkin individually. What I love about this was we never thought of this idea. Myself and my co-founder Dave wouldn't need this feature as it's just us two. Yet when other people use your product, there are always things they find that you don't. We're so lucky that they took the time to give us the feedback.
