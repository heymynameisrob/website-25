Ernest Hemingway kept a chart beside his office desk to log his daily word count. 
When asked why, he said it 'kept him honest.'

Most companies track progress in some form. While this is often used for management oversight, progress logging offers benefits beyond micro-management. These reports serve as journals, providing a window into not just what you accomplished, but how you felt about the work.

When reflecting on your workday, you typically ask yourself: 'What did I get done today?'
This question helps you review your accomplishments. While people tend to focus on measurable outputs - emails sent, meetings attended, code written - it's equally important to consider your emotional response to the work:

- Were you productive? 
- Did you struggle with something? 
- Did you have your best idea yet?

In cushion.so, we built **Automatic Checkins** for this purpose.

Cushion is a collaboration app that helps distributed teams organize projects, communicate, and accomplish their goals. Checkins help team members update each other about their progress, keeping everyone aligned - like a standup, but better.

Daily checkins involve everyone, from the CEO to junior engineers, making work transparent across the company.

Team owners can configure checkins in their 'Workspace settings' by setting a regular reminder time. We've found that teams vary in their preferences - some schedule checkins early in the day, while others prefer end-of-day updates.

We maintain an open format for checkins. There are no mandatory questions or required responses. This flexibility allows people to express what they consider important in their own words.

### Connecting Your Work
Work happens across multiple platforms - whether it's writing posts, updating CRM systems, or pushing code. We automatically import high-priority activities from Cushion into checkins, including written posts, resolved discussions, and provided feedback.

This automation eliminates the need to manually track daily activities, allowing users to focus on meaningful reflection about their work.

We also offer key integrations. Since most Cushion users are technical teams, we prioritized GitHub integration. We automatically track PR activities including opens, merges, and review requests.

Checkins remain in beta as we continue testing and improving the feature.
