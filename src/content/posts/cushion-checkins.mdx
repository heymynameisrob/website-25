Everybody hates status meetings.

Working in software teams, however, they seem like a necessercary evil. People need to know what's going on.
So they start innocently enough. 

9AM you dial in with the rest of your team, taking turns updating each other on who did what yesterday. 
Your update might take 10 seconds, it could take a few minutes. 
Nobody else is really listening other than your manager who takes down what you said.
Now you sit there not really listening to everyone talk about what they did. 
This can usually spiral out into an hour long debate between two people on the same project who live debug code
or dicuss a design decision live on the call.
Aftewards your manager closes the call, and goes to their status meeting where they update their boss on what their team is doing.
Their boss goes to their status meeting and updates their boss, and so on and so on.

This is a huge waste of time within a company. Hours upon hours dedicated to giving updates about the work instead of doing the work.
Also these updates don't last. They are never documented and are usually just a game of telephone to upper managers to see how the department is progressing.
So you skip a few, say 'nothing from me' on a couple and the whole thing becomes a perfomative pain the in the ass.

Everybody hates status meetings.

But in reality status meetings should be positive thing. It's a good way for you to recap 'a good days work'. 
It should be a way to log your progress so you can look back on what you did over days, weeks, or months.
You should be able see your productivity ebb and flow, empowering you to make changes when you slump and feel good about your self when your shine.

In cushion.so, we built Automatiac Checkins for this purpose. Updating what work you've done should be a pain-free point of pride.

### Fewer meetings, more checkins

- Show demo of UI, show fancy animations
- Explain github integration
- Show feedback (e.g Ashley, Dave, Pawel)
- Discuss future improvements like AI summary and automated checks
