# Building UI primitives for artificial.io

[Artificial](https://artificial.io) makes complex insurance frictionless with powerful, automated products.

I worked with Artificial late 2024. Whilst there, I built a complete set of UI components we called "Primitives". These were basic React components that allowed us to prototype, in-code, with production level quality.

## Background
When working on a complete re-design of the main web product, we realised that we weren't moving as fast as we'd like.
Our engineers were busy working on heavy tasks on the backend, mainly with algorithmic or AI work.

This meant any frontend, and UX tasks were being cut in scope to accomodate timelines.
Our UI was a rats nest of custom components and hacks that made experimenting with ideas a chore.
Designers were constrained to Figma (despite all being able to code), which required suspending disbelief to understand if ideas would work or not.

To top it all off, it’s unclear how components and patterns should be used. They are usually created to solve a specific problem at the time. But if someone else runs into a similar problem, that context was never taken into account, and now that component is barely reusable.

## Building the toolbox

What we needed were __component primitives__, composable peices we could stitch together to build interfaces.

Back in the day, lots of products are built on top of UI frameworks like Material UI or Bootstrap.
We needed something in this vain but with a higher degree of flexibility and quality.

I started a side-project whilst working on the larger artificial redesign project. They increased the speed of the project by 5x.
We could scaffold a basic UI in a few lines of code. Previously, you'd have to sketch everything out on Figma or work with another engineer to build something out together.
Now we could build a working prototype, in production (behind a flag), and get feedback directly.

## Protoyping with LLMs
Most of the design team used Cursor, in particular the composer, to help spin up prototypes quickly.
We added a set of `.cursorrules` that instructs the model to prefer `/primitives` when prototype new components.

As well as using the primitives we also included some general best-practices such as using the Rules of React and following our lint guidelines.
This means we can transfer from prototype to production code a lot quicker, without having to refactor generic AI output.

## Example
Primitives are stored in a seperate NPM package in our monorepo accesible via `@primitives/*`.
You can import each individual primitive as and when you need it.
We documented each component using Storybook, which gave us a place to play with each component.

Each primitive aims to use a [compound component](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks) approach.
This takes advantage of one of the main benefits of React – Composability.

Compound components are natural and easy to write. They are closer to the native elements and provide nice, readable code.

Look at this Menu example.

<UIExample client:load>
```tsx
import { Avatar } from "@primitives/avatar";
import {
  FilterMenu,
  FilterMenuContent,
  FilterMenuInput,
  FilterMenuItem,
  FilterMenuList,
  FilterMenuTrigger,
} from "@primitives/filter-menu";

<FilterMenu>
  <FilterMenuTrigger>
    <Avatar src={user.avatar} />
    {selectedUser}
  </FilterMenuTrigger>
  <FilterMenuContent>
    <FilterMenuInput />
    <FilterMenuList>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <FilterMenuItem value={user.id}>
          <Avatar src={user.avatar} />
          {user.name}
        </FilterMenuItem>
      ))}
    </FilterMenuList>
  </FilterMenuContent>
</FilterMenu>
```
</UIExample>

Each piece (`<FilterMenuTrigger />`, `<FilterMenuContent />`, etc.) handles a specific concern while maintaining a connection to the parent `<FilterMenu />` component through React's context.

The component follows React's composability principle - instead of one large monolithic component with many props, it's broken down into logical pieces that work together. This matches how we think about UI elements naturally (a menu has a trigger, content, items etc.) and makes the code more maintainable.

Looking at the implementation, you can see how each piece serves a clear purpose:
- `<FilterMenuTrigger />` handles the button that opens the menu
- `<FilterMenuInput />` provides search functionality
- `<FilterMenuList />` and `<FilterMenuItem />` handle the options

This pattern scales well as complexity grows. Need to add a section header? Just create a `<FilterMenuHeader />` component. Need custom styling for certain items? Style the `<FilterMenuItem />` directly. The API remains intuitive while being extremely flexible.
