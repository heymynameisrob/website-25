I find the best way to start with designing is to make sure you have a high-quality set of parts.
These are different to tools. Things like Figma. Or a nice monitor. Although those things are important.

A mechanic will have good quality parts they can grab of the shelf to fix something.
They'll have certain suppliers they use to source things they need.
They use certain brands of wrenches, oils, and even cleaning fluids.

As a designer you need these too.
Mostly designers work with the parts that are handed to them. Either by a framework like Material UI or what existing code has already been written.
So when you need, say a Tabs component, you have to go make one. This slows you down. That component should exist already. You should be able to slot something in to solve such as common problem.

A good library of primitives, utilities, and hooks can save you a huge amount of time when prototyping.
It's the first thing I try to do when working on a new project for myself or even with clients.

Being able to prototype in code with usable parts that can easily work in production means we go faster.
