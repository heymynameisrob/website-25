A series of learnings about adding motion into user interfaces on the web. I've learnt a lot of these over the years, particularly when working with React.

## Why animations are useful

Animation can bring life and joy to an interface. Whether they are animations via interactions (e.g clicking on a button) or orchestarted (e.g animating a moving carousel) - motion can give the product a way to express itself. Just like the visual style or language it uses, motion can have a certain tone or message it's trying to convey.

The web is traditionally a static, document-based medium. The introduction of the iPhone meant opening up a whole new world of sophisticated animations users are now acustom to seeing. Even with new API's and browser capability, this poses challenges on the web.

## Easings & Duration

Easing and duration determine how an animation _feels_.

This plays an important role what the animation communicates.
Easing and duration can also influence the perception of speed. The popover on the left below uses `ease-in` easing, which starts slow. The one on the right uses `ease-out`, which makes the animation feel faster.

[DEMO]

To know what easing & duration to choose, it comes down to experimentation. However I've found I usually stick to `150ms - 300ms` and these easings:

```css
:root {
  /* Elements enter/leave the viewport */
  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.61, 0.355, 1);

  /* Elements change position on the viewport */
  --ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1);

  /* Use linear for constant, keyframe animations */
}
```

## Gestures

Gestures are inherent parts of user interfaces. We use them constantly to trigger events (e.g clicking a button, hovering over a link). Adding subtle animation can help make these moments feel alive.

[DEMO]

Adding `active:scale-[0.98]` to the button is a low-effort way to make the click feel much more tactile

## Using clip-path animations

`clip-path` is an often overlooked CSS function, typically used to drawing shapes around nodes. But it works great for creating interesting animations.

[DEMO]

Stacking these images and adding `clip-path: (0 var(--pos) 0 0)` whilst we animating the value (e.g 50%) creates this before/after slider.

## Between states

Animating transitions between states, such as changing the month on a calendar, can bring the interface to life. When orchestrating motion like this, I use React Motion as working with pure CSS can be fiddly.

<UIExample component="motion-calendar" client:load />

Motion is determined by the state of `key` on the motion component. The container determines the start, middle, and end state of the animation - triggered when `month` changes.

```tsx
<AnimatePresence initial={false}>
  <motion.div
    key={month}
    inital={{ x: 40, opacity: 0, filter: "blur(2px)" }}
    animate={{ x: 0, opacity: 1, filter: "blur(0px)" }}
    exist={{ x: -40, opacity: 0, filter: "blur(2px)" }}
    transition={{ type: "spring", bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 }} // Consider using ease-out
  >
    {month}
  </motion.div>
</AnimatePresence>
```

## Animating gradients

Gradients are useful primitives to animate. You can create interesting visual expressions by animating an element with a gradient or the gradient itself. By layering elements on top of animating gradients, you can creating novel light-based animations that work well for interesting loaders.

<UIExample component="motion-loader" client:load />

In this example, we're animating a `conic` gradient, layering on top another element to exclude it. When the state changes from `loading` to `success` when changing the gradient and stop the linear animation so the spinner fades out.

```html
<div
  className="relative flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden rounded-full p-[2px]"
>
  <div
    class="absolute -inset-10 bg-[conic-gradient(from_0deg,transparent_0%,var(--color-accent)_25%,transparent_35%)] animate-spin"
  ></div>
  <div
    className="z-1 flex items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-gray-2 p-0.5"
  >
    <div className="size-[64px] grid place-items-center p-1 rounded-2xl">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Animating layout

Animating layout can cause layout shifts and expensive repainting if you're not careful. But changing the dimensions of a container helps reduce wasted space and focuses the attention.

<UIExample component="motion-responsive" client:load />

Measuring the inner content and animating the `height` value can adapt the container nicely to the content whenever it changes.

```tsx
const [ref, bounds] = useMeasure();

<motion.div
  animate={{ height: bounds.height }}
  transition={{ type: "spring", bounce: 0, duration: 0.4 }}
>
  <div ref={ref} className="inner-content">
    ...
  </div>
</motion.div>;
```

## Magic Text

Carefully using orchestration allows you to create more interesting animations. One of the best and simplest techniques for orchestration is **staggering**. By staggering each character, we can animate the text in like magic!

<UIExample component="motion-magic-text" client:load>
  Using a slight blur and spring animation brings this to life
</UIExample>

Seperating each word allows us more control. Always remember to add the full text for screen readers so they don't announce each word seperately.

```tsx
<div>
  <span className="sr-only">{word}</span>
  {words.map((w, i) => (
    <motion.span
      key={i}
      initial={{ y: 16, originY: 0.2, filter: "blur(4px)", opacity: 0 }}
      animate={{ y: 0, originY: 0.2, filter: "blur(0px)", opacity: 1 }}
      transition={{
        type: "spring",
        stiffness: 250,
        damping: 30,
        delay: i * 0.05,
      }}
    >
      {w}
    </motion.span>
  ))}
</div>
```
